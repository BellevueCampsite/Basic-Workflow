# Basic-Workflow
A workflow to describe how we can work on group projects together

Here are the basic workflow steps when working on a project.

1. Project A is created by a team member. 
2. Other team members that want to work on the project fork a copy of the repo onto their personal github profiles
  original repo -> fork -> user's github profile
3. User clones their forked copy down to their local system ```git clone url-of-forked-copy```
